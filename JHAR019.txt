QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  Occasionally we require the aid of experts beyond
<ce>  our own ranks, much as we try to avoid it.
<ce>  Some pieces of history are simply beyond our grasp.
<ce>  If you have some time and coin, we need you to
<ce>  act as our agent for one such errand. You will
<ce>  be fully reimbursed, I assure you.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     Too poor or too cheap, %pcf?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  We have here this _tri_ which has some particular
<ce>  purpose, but we can't figure out what it is.
<ce>  Our testing has failed us. We're certain we can
<ce>  rely on _exp_, who's visiting this region
<ce>  for a short while. Find %g2, get %g3 assessment,
<ce>  and finish the investigation with %g3 expertise.
<ce>  I understand %g3 fee is 400 gold pieces this
<ce>  season, so go prepared. Return in two months
<ce>  or earlier with the investigation finished.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  Your two months to consult with _exp_
<ce>  and finish the investigation are over.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Well done, %pcf. Take your 400 gold piece
<ce>  reimbursement for _exp_, as well as your
<ce>  own payment. We'll take our time to get this
<ce>  thing open and see its contents.

%qdt:
 __qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 needs me to find _exp_, a particular
 expert for one _tri_ that I carry.
 I am to pay %g3 for the help I need, then
 use _tri_ for its intended purpose and
 deliver the results to the Archaeologists.
 My work is due within =timer_ days.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 _exp_ informed me that the trinket
 came from ___farmhome_ and is likely
 linked to some object buried there.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 _exp_ offered to buy the trinket for
 =bribe_ gold pieces, and I took %g2 up
 on it. All's well that ends well, right?

Message:  1013
Staying in ___lib_, I hear.
<--->
_exp_ was seen in ___lib_, I think.
<--->
_exp_? Dunno how long %g1's been in ___lib_, I'd try there.

Message:  1020
<ce> "Fair day, %ra. How can I assist you?
<ce> 
<ce> "Yes, I believe I can help you. The payment will
<ce> be 400 gold pieces, and I can tell you where this
<ce> came from and what its purpose is. However, perhaps you'd
<ce> give me a chance? I'd be more than happy to buy it from you
<ce> for =bribe_ gold pieces. It's worth more than what you'll
<ce> get from it, I'm sure, but one of my expertise could
<ce> stand to gain more still. What do you say?"
<ce> 
<ce> Do you sell the object (yes) or pay for %g3 help (no)?

Message:  1021
<ce> "A good deal for us all, I think. It'd take years of my expertise
<ce> to fully develop this thing's potential. Take your money.
<ce> Farewell, and safe travels."

Message:  1022
<ce> You... what? You idiot! That was guild property! You had
<ce> no right to sell it! Stupid! Moron! I need to find someone
<ce> to contact _exp_, right now. Maybe we can get it back.
<ce> 
<ce> How could you be so thoughtless?!

Message:  1030
<ce> "As you wish. Let me read this for a minute.
<ce> 
<ce> "Its locational signature points to... Let me see
<ce> your map. ___farmhome_, here in %crn.
<ce> This _tri_ has some attraction power to it, so if you
<ce> activate it on the property, it should lead you
<ce> to the thing you're looking for. I hope it's
<ce> worth it. Safe travels."

Message:  1031
<ce> The _tri_ has started to buzz. It must be
<ce> reacting to something nearby.

Message:  1032
<ce> The _tri_ leads you only a few steps away before
<ce> it seems to pull itself downward. A shallow
<ce> mound beneath your feet yields easily,
<ce> and you find a wooden chest in the ground.
<ce> No one stops you from taking it.
<ce> It looks too frail for casual probing, so
<ce> you decide not to open it yourself.

Message:  1033
<ce> "Ahem. You don't have 400 gold pieces, do you?"
