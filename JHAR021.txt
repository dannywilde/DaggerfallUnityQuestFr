<ce>  Lord Bertram Spode, when he isn't on the
<ce>  governing council of Glenpoint, has a
<ce>  retirement home here in %crn.
<ce>  He has made a large donation to the guild
<ce>  in exchange for an odd artifact we
<ce>  recently unearthed in the area.
<ce>  We need someone trustworthy to deliver
<ce>  it to him. Can you go?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Please change your mind.
<ce>  This needs to get delivered.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Here. It's this decrepit finger.
<ce>  No, it doesn't summon mummies or anything
<ce>  grotesque like that. Spode has some bizarre
<ce>  fascination with it, and we don't know why.
<ce>  Sufficient to say, his donation will keep
<ce>  us in %crn for the next few years, so
<ce>  he deserves it. Find him at ___farmhome_.
<ce>  He's staying in the palace for now.
<ce>  If he doesn't have it within =timer_ days
<ce>  your standing with us will fall drastically.
<ce>  Ever onward, %pcf.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  You needed to deliver the finger to
<ce>  Lord Spode by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Aah, yesss, the Archaeologists have
<ce>  come through for me. They didn't forget
<ce>  after all. I was worried. And to think
<ce>  they have no idea what this little thing
<ce>  is capable of! No one does! Ha ha!
<ce>  Here, take this money. I expect
<ce>  it'll keep you quiet, hmm?
