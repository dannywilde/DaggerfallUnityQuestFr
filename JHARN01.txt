<ce>  We don't really have time for outsiders here.
<ce>  Much of our work is confidential and requires
<ce>  discretion, which we cannot know you have.
<ce>  If you wish to gain favor with our guild,
<ce>  what would you say to a small donation
<ce>  to the cause? Say, to the tune of 2,000 gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   If you'll be going, I need to attend to other members' needs.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>   Ah, a worthy decision. Those who donate to the
<ce>  Archaeologists are always kept in fond memory.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  You were expected to donate 2,000 gold pieces
<ce>  to the Archaeologists of ___qgiver_ by now.

<ce>  (You deliver 2,000 gold coins to _qgiver_.
<ce>  After counting them out, %g1 smiles.)
<ce> 
<ce>  "Excellent, my friend. I'll be informing
<ce>  our local members of this donation.
<ce>  Your generosity will not be forgotten, not at all."

%qdt:
 I tried to donate 2,000 gold pieces to
 the Archaeologist Guild of ___qgiver_,
 but did not have enough on hand.
 I can do so within 24 hours to
 curry some favor with them.

<ce>  (You search for 2,000 gold coins, but
<ce>  do not have them. _qgiver_ is not amused.)
<ce>  
<ce>  "No letters of credit, no vague promises.
<ce>  Cold, hard money is what we need.
<ce>  If you can bring it here within 24 hours,
<ce>  I'll make certain mention of you to
<ce>  the Master of this hall."

<ce>  the Master of this hall."
