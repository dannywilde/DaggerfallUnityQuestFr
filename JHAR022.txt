QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  If you're feeling particularly brave, we have a request
<ce>  to unearth an object in some ruins that could prove
<ce>  a bit perilous. If you're going to accept this one,
<ce>  make sure you're combat-ready and capable of harming
<ce>  the supernatural.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     Well, we need members for clerical work too, I suppose.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>    I'll mark ___dungeon_ on your map.
<ce>    The _mitem_ you'll recover has caused some trouble with the dead.
<ce>    I'd think you would be doing them a favor by removing it,
<ce>    but perhaps rational thought is expecting too much of them.
<ce>    Have it here by =traveltime_ days. You'll be given a training
<ce>    session as a reward, in addition to =reward_ gold pieces.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  You needed to return to the
<ce>  Archaeologists in ___questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>    You show _questgiver_ the dissolved remains
<ce>  of the _mitem_, and the intact inscription.
<ce>  After burying %g3 face in %g3 hands, %g1 pounds
<ce>  the wall out of frustration.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Cursed _mitem_, very funny. What a waste of time.
<ce>  I can't take this out on you, though.
<ce>  You did your part. First, take your gold reward."

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of the
 Archaeologists has sent me to
 ___dungeon_ to get some _mitem_
 with a connection to the dead.
 I must return with it to
 ___questgiver_ in =traveltime_ days
 for my reward of gold and training.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You reach to pick up the _mitem_
<ce>  the guild sent you to find, and you're surprised
<ce>  to see an inscription on it.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Must remain underground!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Warning or not, you have no choice.
<ce>  You grab it and put it away.
<ce>  The air turns oppressive. You're concerned
<ce>  that the dead have only grown more agitated now.

Message:  1012
<ce>  Free of the haunted depths, you reach back and look
<ce>  for the _mitem_. To your horror, you find it dissolving
<ce>  into dust. You try to grab at it, but within moments
<ce>  it is mere powder. The only thing remaining is the
<ce>  inscription: "Must remain underground!"
<ce>  
<ce>  You hope the Archaeologists will still accept it.

Message:  1013
<ce>  "Next, you can have complimentary training in exchange
<ce>  for your service. Would you like a lesson in Orcish
<ce>  or Impish?"
<ce>  
<ce>  (ACCEPT: Orcish)
<ce>  (YES: Impish)
<ce>  (CANCEL: Skip the training)

Message:  1014
<ce>  You enjoy an in-depth training session on the
<ce>  nature of the Orcish language by one of the
<ce>  higher-ranking members of this location.

Message:  1015
<ce>  You enjoy an in-depth training session on the
<ce>  nature of the Impish language by one of the
<ce>  higher-ranking members of this location.

Message:  1016
<ce>  You forego the lesson reward.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Very well then. Your service is appreciated."
