<ce>   You'll do perfectly for this one. We need
<ce>   someone who is completely trustworthy to
<ce>   merely deliver a powerful artifact.
<ce>   Will you help us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   Quite unfortunate.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>   Then I will present to you the Staff of Magnus.
<ce>   Truly the stuff of legends. It needs to get to
<ce>   ___dest_ in =timer_ days' time.
<ce>   Look for _kni_ in _dest_.
<ce>   We suspect you'll be followed by less scrupulous
<ce>   persons interested in obtaining it through
<ce>   illegitimate means. Be sure to defend yourself
<ce>   as necessary. Safe journey.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>   Stolen? That is a tragedy. You must not rest
<ce>   until it is in _kni_'s hands.

QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce>   Ah, the Staff of Magnus! This will be of great
<ce>   worth for a certain task we've been planning.
<ce>   Thank you for bringing it without harm.
<ce>   
<ce>   We didn't allot a formal reward for you out
<ce>   of our coffers, but we wanted to show our
<ce>   appreciation a different way. Please take it
<ce>   and use it however you like. One day it will
<ce>   change hands, and someone else will enjoy
<ce>   its power, for better or for worse.

<ce>   Somehow, a group of cruel-looking people
<ce>   has gotten the drop on you. In fact, the
<ce>   number is so great that you're thoroughly
<ce>   surprised you didn't notice them before.
<ce>   Either they are very good at what they do,
<ce>   some sort of magic is helping them, or both.
<ce>   
<ce>   "Quick! Get the staff from %pg2!"
<ce>   
<ce>   You take a defensive stance but are shoved
<ce>   from behind. Your foes form a circle around
<ce>   you and toss you back and forth among them,
<ce>   scarcely letting you maintain balance. In the
<ce>   bedlam you feel the Staff of Magnus leave
<ce>   your possession, though you can't tell
<ce>   who took it. Once they see it come loose,
<ce>   the majority of the band roars with delight
<ce>   and escapes. A few stay behind to delay you.

Message:  1011
It got stolen from you? Wow, just yesterday I lost Chrysamere! Hahaha!
<--->
You should retrace your steps. That's how I find stuff I forgot.
<--->
You should look for people who sell stolen stuff. Like _fence_.

Message:  1012
That _fence_, always trying to make a big name for %g2self.
<--->
_fence_ is becoming quite notorious.
<--->
_fence_ is going for the big game these days, they says.
<--->
_fence_ lives in ___fenceplace_. Why'd you ask?

Message:  1013
<ce>  Good %god! %oth, and by my life!
<ce>  No, I had nothing to do with the Staff
<ce>  of Magnus hit! I don't get involved with
<ce>  that stuff! I pick pockets at bars, not
<ce>  sell artifacts on the black market!
<ce>  On my mother's grave, go to ___dummyplace_
<ce>  and talk to _dummy_. He's in
<ce>  _dummyplace_. That's who stole it
<ce>  from you!

Message:  1014
<ce>  You suddenly sense movement. Three cloaked
<ce>  figures have gotten the jump on you.
<ce>  Whoever these people are, they are good.

Message:  1015
<ce>  This parchment contains no writing.
<ce>  It only holds a roughly-drawn
<ce>  map leading from ___dung_,
<ce>  to the %di.

Message:  1016
<ce>  _fence_'s face turns pale
<ce>  at seeing you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You never should have never come here!
<ce>  My client needs the Staff of Magnus
<ce>  more than you do! You have no idea
<ce>  what you're interrupting here!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Nevertheless, he enters a battle stance
<ce>  to defend himself.

Message:  1017
<ce>  The staff appears undamaged.
<ce>  Now, finally, you can deliver it.

Message:  1018
<ce>  A short, sharp whistle pierces
<ce>  the air once you enter.
<ce>  Your arrival has been noticed.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I have been entrusted with the Staff
 of Magnus, a powerful artifact.
 The Archaeologists need me to deliver
 it to _kni_ of ___dest_ at _dest_
 in =timer_ days' time.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The Staff of Magnus has been stolen
 from me by a mob. I need to try to
 recover it, I should ask around.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 _fence_, a known fence
 of stolen goods in ___fenceplace_,
 swore that he doesn't know who took
 the Staff from me, though he knew it happened.
 He told me to talk to _dummy_,
 who lives in ___dummyplace_
 at _dummyplace_.

Message:  1033
%qdt:
 The house where _dummy_
 lives, if %g1's a real person at all,
 was a trap. On some assailants there
 I found some directions leading
 from a den called ___dung_
 in ____dung_.

Message:  1034
