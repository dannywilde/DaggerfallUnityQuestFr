QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>     You're a trusted member of the guild, and we
<ce>  feel to entrust certain sensitive matters to you.
<ce>  We can offer you some gold and a language training
<ce>  session if you can root out an apparent spy
<ce>  in the guild.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    So be it. We'll handle it ourselves.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>    What a relief. Our concern deals with a colleague
<ce>  named _person_ who also resides here in town,
<ce>  living in a house called _res_.
<ce>  We find that many matters that he's explored
<ce>  end up getting spearheaded by the Mages Guild,
<ce>  or that the Thieves Guild gets a jump start on
<ce>  our work. We suspect %g2 too much to ignore the matter.
<ce>  Find proof of his doings, and we'll reward you accordingly.
<ce>  I don't want this to take longer than three days.

Message:  1003
<ce>  You were to deliver proof of _person_'s
<ce>  treachery to the Archaeologists by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  "Very clever. I trusted in you with good cause.
<ce>  I have gold here for you, first of all."

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Archaeologists
 in ___qgiver_ needs me to find proof that
 _person_ has been going behind the
 guild's back and giving sensitive material
 to outsiders. I have =timer_ days
 to find such proof, if any exists.
 _person_ lives in _res_,
 if that's relevant.

Message:  1011
If you're looking for _person_, you might also want to check %g3 room at _tav_.
<--->
Spends %g3 time at _tav_ when %g1's too drunk to stay at home, I guess.

Message:  1012
<ce>  What in Oblivion? Who are you? %oth,
<ce>  get out of here. I don't want to be bothered
<ce>  by upstarts like yourself, lest a fight break out
<ce>  and you find yourself on the losing end.

Message:  1013
<ce>  This letter appears to belong to _person_
<ce>  and contain highly relevant information.

Message:  1014
With regards to your previous letter
<ce>
No, they're going to ___dung_ soon. Some kind of
exceptional find down there. It's going to take them
a few days to get their act together and start moving
so you can still beat them
<ce>
I am also not impressed by my recent lack of payment
Other people would pay me double for all the
help I've given you. Rethink your priorities

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 I have found incriminating evidence against
 _person_. The choice is now mine to
 confront %g1 with the proof or deliver
 it to the guild hall.

Message:  1016
<ce>  You show the letter to _person_
<ce>  and demand an answer.
<ce>  Rather than respond for %g2self, %g1 shouts,
<ce>  "You'll not take me alive!"

Message:  1017
<ce>  You've resolved the matter yourself.
<ce>  It's time to report your success
<ce>  to _qgiver_.

Message:  1018
<ce>  You deliver the letter to _qgiver_.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Yes! Precisely! This is the kind of proof
<ce>  we need. Excellent work! This is grounds
<ce>  for expulsion. We'll get moving on this right
<ce>  away. Well done, %pcf!"

Message:  1019
<ce>  "Next, you can choose between a complimentary
<ce>  lesson in Nymph or Dragonish. Do either of
<ce>  those appeal to you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  (ACCEPT: Nymph)
<ce>  (YES: Dragonish)
<ce>  (CANCEL: Skip the training)

Message:  1020
<ce>  You enjoy an in-depth training session on the
<ce>  nature of the Nymph language by one of the
<ce>  higher-ranking members of this location.

Message:  1021
<ce>  You enjoy an in-depth training session on the
<ce>  nature of the Dragonish language by one of the
<ce>  higher-ranking members of this location.

Message:  1022
<ce>  You forego the lesson reward.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Very well then. Your service is appreciated."

Message:  1023
<ce>  You tell _qgiver_ of the proof you found
<ce>  and of _person_'s death.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, I don't think anyone will make a controversy
<ce>  of it. We're all much better off without a spy.
<ce>  As far as I'm concerned, this settles the matter."
