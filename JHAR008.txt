QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>	Our association attracts all manner of people,
<ce>	and not all merit our trust. Occasionally we make
<ce>	mistakes. I need someone to retrieve some _tri_
<ce>	one of our members, or former members, has
<ce>	absconded with. Will you exact a punishment
<ce>	and recover what has been stolen?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>	How shall we rely on you?
<--->
<ce>	We need your help in something, at least.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>	To be clear, we do not know where _dummy_ has gone.
<ce>	You'll have to do both the detective and legwork to get it
<ce>	back. I hope our reward of =reward_ gold pieces will
<ce>	be sufficient for the effort. Please have the _tri_
<ce>	here within =timer_ days. Best of luck.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>	Excellent work. Do not be concerned for our friend's
<ce>	life. Sooner or later the same would have occurred
<ce>	by someone else's hand. No one will raise an eyebrow.
<ce>	Have your fee and my thanks.
