  It seems this "good luck" finger has some tricks about it that
must be tamed before a good politician may unleash its power.
To give an example, I recently wished that my wife would
stop bothering me about our judicious use of finances.
My specific wording was, "Just stop talking, you old harpy!"
Sadly, the finger's enchantment was active and heard my words.
I was quite surprised and displeased to see her transform into
a large bird, albeit mute. She now hovers about the property,
and none of my servants dare kill her.
<ce>
  Therefore, I call upon you. I blame you for delivering this
stupid finger to me and depriving me of my wife of the last
three years. I demand you arrive at ___res_
and slay this bird pretending to be my wife, as we would say.
Should you fail to do so within =timer_ days,
I assure you that every form of slander will be used
to ruin your reputation. You will not want to suffer this
at my hand.
<ce> 
                     Season's Greetings,
                     Lord Bertram Spode

<ce> You approach the property and find the harpy,
<ce> or Lord Spode's wife, flying and squawking about.
<ce> With an angry yell, she determines you a threat
<ce> and moves to attack.

%qdt:
 Lord Bertram Spode has made poor decisions
 with the "good luck" finger I delivered to
 him on behalf of the Archaeologists,
 and in his tantrum wants to blame me for
 the consequences. He demands that I go
 to ___res_ of ____res_ and
 slay his wife, who is now a harpy.
 If I fail to do this, he will spread rumors
 to ruin my reputation.

<ce>  Lord Spode demanded that you kill the harpy
<ce>  on his property by now.
