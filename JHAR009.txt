<ce>         An object was recently brought in with a nasty curse of sorts.
<ce>         Left alone the _trink_ is harmless, but once it touches
<ce>         warm flesh of any kind, its previous master will perceive
<ce>         its location and slay whoever possesses it. The fact
<ce>         that this master is a daedra should give you pause, %pct.
<ce>         We require someone to hold this object and defeat the foe
<ce>         so we can get it recorded and evaluated. Will you be
<ce>         the one to do it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Well, if you change your mind, the _trink_ will surely be here.
<--->
<ce>         I suppose someone else could eventually kill it by sheer luck.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         Here it is. We cannot possibly tell how long it will take to find
<ce>         you. Who knows in what region the creature makes its home.
<ce>         All we know is that, however long it takes, it comes to kill.
<ce>         Be prepared for battle. Return to me when the task is finished.
<ce>         Farewell, and let whatever god you worship be with you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         You have avoided this daedra for long enough. You discard the
<ce>         _trink_ and get on with your life.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>         My fears have been assuaged. No one here doubts your ability,
<ce>         but any time we combine the words "task" and "daedra," we discard
<ce>         all guarantees concerning the future. I certainly believe you have
<ce>         earned these =reward_ gold pieces.

Message:  1017
<ce>         A harsh voice cries out nearby.
<ce>         
<ce>         "Filthy mortal! Why must you desecrate it with your
<ce>         puny hands? The vengeance of Oblivion be upon you!"

Message:  1018
<ce>         You stand triumphant over the daedra's corpse.
<ce>         It's time to return to _qgiver_ and deliver
<ce>         the _trink_.
