<ce>                 The Archaeologists have a reputation for
<ce>                 excellence, knowledge, and precision, which
<ce>                 we credit in part to members such as yourself,
<ce>                 and in another part to possessing the best research.
<ce>                 We have received word that some novice from
<ce>                 the Mages Guild, _scholar_, is
<ce>                 currently in ___dest_ with some notes we
<ce>                 would find particularly useful at this time. We need
<ce>                 someone to go retrieve them under the right guise.
<ce>                 Are you able to do this, %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 We have had a bit of a rocky history with the Mages
<ce>                 Guild in the past for a variety of reasons. We, 
<ce>                 like many, hate their high-mindedness and their
<ce>                 insistence on keeping their work so private. We can
<ce>                 remedy the second problem this very season. Some mage,
<ce>                 _scholar_, is staying in ___dest_ with
<ce>                 a set of notes we consider to be of great worth. We request
<ce>                 that you go and retrieve them for us.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Then what are you doing here? Shoo.
<--->
<ce>                  Then step aside. This needs to be done by someone.
<--->
<ce>                  Then would you leave, please? There
<ce>                  is work to be done here.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Very good. And remember, it's in ___dest_.
<ce>                   Now, first of all, make no mention of your identity.
<ce>                   Find some way to get those notes, preferably without
<ce>                   making a murderer of yourself. We need no such
<ce>                   reputation in this guild. Our parallel research project
<ce>                   will be underway in =queston_ days, such that your mission
<ce>                   will be a failure if you have not returned by that time.
<ce>                   Be cautious, %pcf. Fare thee well.
<--->
<ce>                   I don't know how long _scholar_ will remain in
<ce>                   ___dest_, so time is of the essence. I will have
<ce>                   _reward_ gold pieces for you when you return.
<ce>                   Please, just ensure you can't be called a murderer
<ce>                   when this is over. Just be back here in one piece
<ce>                   without tarnishing our good name. We need it
<ce>                   in no more than =queston_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Wonderful, %pcf. I merely hope you covered your
<ce>              tracks before returning to ___qgiver_. If the town
<ce>              guard come looking for you, I will offer no excuses.
<ce>              But here, take your reward.


QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 The Archaeologists in ___qgiver_
 have asked me to get research notes
 from _scholar_, who is staying
 at ___dest_. I should
 be back within =queston_ days.

Message:  1020
<ce>               Wait, who are you? My research
<ce>               notes? But I just finished them.
<ce>               Did _dummy_ send you?
<--->
<ce>               I have no idea who you are or why
<ce>               you would ask for my research.
<ce>               I treasure it above my own life.
<ce>               Did _dummy_ give you permission
<ce>               to ask for this?

Message:  1021
<ce>               Well, all right then. I'll need it back within
<ce>               _falsetimer_ days. If you're not here by
<ce>               then I'll be going to ___falsehouse_
<ce>               and you'll have to catch up to me there.
<ce>               %oth, sometimes the Mages Guild
<ce>               is more trouble than it's worth.
<--->
<ce>               This is troubling. I can't go lending out my latest
<ce>               research to every %ra the guild sends to me.
<ce>               I need you to take it to me in ___falsehouse_
<ce>               when they're finished, and tell _dummy_ that
<ce>               this is the last time I'm bothering with this nonsense.

Message:  1022
<ce>               Then I will cast you back from whence you came!
<--->
<ce>               Begone, %ra! You will have none of my work!

Message:  1023
<ce>               You knock _scholar_ off balance
<ce>               and  quickly snatch the parchment.
<ce>               It's time to head back to ___qgiver_.

Message:  1024
<ce>               _scholar_ lies dead at your feet. No
<ce>               doubt word of this will get around %crn.

Message:  1030
<ce>               Try as you might, you can't break the seal on this document.
<--->
<ce>               This parchment is sealed tightly shut.
<--->
<ce>               The seal on this document is impervious to your attempts.

Message:  1040
<ce>               This is pathetically obvious. I just spoke to
<ce>               _dummy_ yesterday. Do
<ce>               you truly believe I will fall to such a naive lie?
<ce>               Yet experience tells me such a cur as yourself
<ce>               will even slay to obtain trivial notes from
<ce>               an innocent like myself. I therefore make
<ce>               a proposition. I will make a set of false notes
<ce>               which you can take to your godless employer,
<ce>               and no blood will be spilt this day. Isn't that
<ce>               an agreeable resolution to our dilemma, %ra?

Message:  1041
<ce>               Indeed, honour among thieves is meaningless talk.
<ce>               I do thank you, nevertheless, for having an open
<ce>               mind on this matter. Some other thick-headed mercenary
<ce>               would be happier to see me dead than to even retrieve
<ce>               the document. Such is the way of the Iliac Bay these days.
<ce>               
<ce>               There, it is done. Now take it and get yourself lost before
<ce>               I call the guard and we all jump to Oblivion together.

Message:  1042
<ce>               Then I will defend it with my life! Have at you, filthy beast!
<--->
<ce>               Then die! No mercy for criminal scoundrels!
<--->
<ce>               Then there is no hope for you! Die!

Message:  1043
<ce>               You presume this can be counted as
<ce>               self-defense. Now to get the research.
