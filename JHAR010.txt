QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We received a message from a field agent,
<ce> _agent_, stating that %g1
<ce> found something of value. We need someone
<ce> willing to enter the cave %g1 works in
<ce> and bring back the object. Will you
<ce> do it for =reward_ gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Well, it was going to be a bit complicated
<ce> anyway. Not everyone's cup of tea.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> I'll pay you if you bring it here in =timer_
<ce> days. Our agents never disclose their location
<ce> via written communication for their own
<ce> safety, so you'll first have to speak with
<ce> _gate_, who's in ___lib_.
<ce> Take this letter of authenticity. We run a tight ship
<ce> with regards to these matters, so %g1 will disclose
<ce> no information without proof. Stay safe, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You can no longer deliver the
<ce> _item_ to _qgiver_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Welcome back. I see it's in good condition, then.
<ce> Well, here's your pay. Good work.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I wonder what it's like to work for the Archaeologists.

Message: 1020
<ce> Your story is interesting, but I do not believe it.
<ce> If you are a member of the Archaeologists, why have
<ce> I never seen you before? I need proper proof before
<ce> I speak of _agent_'s whereabouts.

Message: 1021
<ce> _gate_ looks at the document carefully,
<ce> and then uses a knife to scratch at a few
<ce> of the letters. Satisfied, %g1 looks up.
<ce> 
<ce> "It's genuine. _agent_ is in
<ce> ___dung_. I'll mark it on your
<ce> map. Be certain you're ready for combat.
<ce> It's no place for a mere compass reader."
<ce> 
<ce> The agent then resumes work, ignoring you.

Message: 1022
<ce> Good day, %ra. Ah, you're here to answer
<ce> my letter? Who told you my location?
<ce> Yes, that's the right answer. Our good
<ce> _gate_, leaving no loose
<ce> ends untied. Well, here it is. Tell
<ce> _qgiver_ I will demand
<ce> an increase in rank when I'm topside.
<ce> It's the least %g1 could do, after all.
<ce> Best of luck on the way back out!

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Archaeologists
 has received word that _agent_,
 a fellow member, has found an object of
 value during a field excavation.
 In accordance with guild rules, %g1 omitted
 %g3 current location. I must speak with
 _gate_ in ___lib_
 to learn where to go, and have received a
 letter proving my authenticity. I will
 be paid =reward_ gold if I deliver it
 to ___qgiver_ in =timer_ days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:

 work within ___dung_.
