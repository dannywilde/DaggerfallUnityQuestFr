QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  As one of the newer guilds in the Iliac Bay,
<ce>  the Archaeologists must fight periodically
<ce>  to maintain our place in %crn. On occasion
<ce>  the powers that be require some verbal persuasion
<ce>  to allow us to continue here. Hopefully we can
<ce>  count on you to placate a noble with a
<ce>  streak of wrath against us.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Someone else will take care of it, I trust.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  The current disagreement regards _nob_,
<ce>  one of the regional nobles living in ___palace_.
<ce>  Please speak to %g2 and get to the bottom of
<ce>  whatever is bothering %g2, before the guild
<ce>  suffers the effects of an overgrown tantrum.
<ce>  Remember: polite speech and patience. I'll need to
<ce>  hear from you within =timer_ days. If things go
<ce>  wrong, I will need time to speak to the others about
<ce>  our future here in ___qgiver_.
<ce>  Our best wishes go with you.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  _qgiver_ sent you to resolve the dispute
<ce>  with _nob_ and return by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  So how did it turn out? Well, that certainly could have
<ce>  been worse. Sometimes we have to fight day after day merely
<ce>  to prove our self-evident worth to the people of %crn.
<ce>  I feel inclined to inform the %t about this harassment.
<ce>  But that's no concern to you. Take this gold. Your
<ce>  work has been more than satisfactory.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Them Archaeologists are good people, I says.
<--->
The Archaeologists and the Mages Guild are always fighting about stuff. %god knows what.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
Someone else stepped up after your failure with _nob_, thank %god.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 The Archaeologists of ___qgiver_
 have sent me to ___palace_ to speak
 to _nob_ concerning some dispute
 about the guild's place in %crn.
 I am to return, problem resolved,
 within =timer_ days.

Message:  1015
<ce>  "Good day. Your name and purpose?
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ah, yes, we have a bit of a disagreement to discuss.
<ce>  Will you take a look at this sheet? Your so-called
<ce>  guild has outlasted its lease in ___qgiver_
<ce>  for over =rand_ months with no excuse provided. As
<ce>  you can see, the building was to be rented only for
<ce>  that period, and then you and your kind should have
<ce>  found some other place in Tamriel to scurry off to.
<ce>  I have no option but to demand that consequences be
<ce>  paid for this flaunting of a legitimate contract."
<ce>  
<ce>  This document bears faded marks that lead you
<ce>  to believe it has been altered. Do you attempt to
<ce>  speak to the fact and foil this apparent plot?

Message:  1016
<ce>  Your attempts at eloquence are bested.
<ce>  _nob_ is outraged by your accusations.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Is that so? You wish to tell me that I have
<ce>  falsified this document to try to get you filthy rats
<ce>  out of %crn? Oh, how pathetic! Good %ra,
<ce>  I could have you arrested right now for impugning my
<ce>  honor and the %t would not think it twice.
<ce>  Consider yourself lucky that I, unlike your kind,
<ce>  abide by the law. I will have nothing further to
<ce>  do with you. Go to my clerk _clerk_
<ce>  in ___ctown_ and pay an administrative fee
<ce>  of 750 gold, lest I send the town guard marching
<ce>  into ___qgiver_ to arrest your bunch of
<ce>  delinquents on the spot. Leave, rodent."

Message:  1017
<ce>  Yes? I understand that the Archaeologists have an
<ce>  administrative fee to pay. Do you have that with
<ce>  you at this time?

Message:  1018
<ce>  Ah, thank you. I accept your payment.
<ce>  _nob_ informed me of the matter and I am
<ce>  happy to settle the account. We will revisit the matter
<ce>  of the building's lease with the guild's leaders some
<ce>  other time. Thank you, %ra.

Message:  1019
%qdt:
 _nob_ refused to look at the evidence
 and demanded that I pay a 750 gold bribe
 to a clerk named _clerk_
 in ___ctown_ to resolve the matter.

Message:  1020
<ce>  _nob_ may be clever, but you are more so.
<ce>  You softly point out a few inconsistencies in the document,
<ce>  deflecting blame to some errant scribe in another city.
<ce>  Though %g1 tries to get angry, you maintain control
<ce>  of the situation.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well. I suppose there is still much to be said
<ce>  for forbearance, isn't there? The Archaeologists
<ce>  are citizens of %crn as much as anyone, as much
<ce>  as it may disappoint civilized folk. Still,
<ce>  what you say may be the truth. I will instruct
<ce>  you to go to my servant _serv_ in ___stown_
<ce>  and say the phrase 'The Archaeologists found
<ce>  a small _gem_,' and %g1 will understand what
<ce>  it means. Good day, %ra."
<ce>  
<ce>  This noble, bested in debate, wants to
<ce>  avoid being accused of falsifying documents
<ce>  before the %t for a petty vendetta. Perhaps
<ce>  this is the best outcome for all this time.

Message:  1021
<ce>  _serv_'s ears perk up upon hearing
<ce>  the code phrase, and %g1 writes something down
<ce>  on a nearby parchment.
<ce>  
<ce>  "This is quite a surprise. Odd to see
<ce>  _nob_ pull back so far from such
<ce>  a determined course, isn't it friend? I am happy to see
<ce>  the Archaeologists persist a little longer in %crn,
<ce>  and I will process the forbearance order. Good day."

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 I caught _nob_ in the lie and
 was instructed to speak a code phrase
 to a servant in ___stown_ named
 _serv_ who can help
 resolve the Archaeologist's difficulty.

Message:  1025
<ce>  The evidence and _nob_'s hostility leave you
<ce>  little defense. Instead of attempting to attack the
<ce>  merits of the claim, you listen to %g3 accusations
<ce>  without further dispute.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, at least one of your kind is willing to listen.
<ce>  I am frankly upset at their flagrant disobedience
<ce>  of law and order, but your example is a small ray of
<ce>  hope. If you will pay a small administrative fee
<ce>  of 300 gold to my assistant _ast_
<ce>  in ___atown_, I will ensure that more time is
<ce>  given before we close the doors of that so-called guild
<ce>  you belong to. Thank you for submitting to the proper
<ce>  order of things, %ra."

Message:  1026
%qdt:
 Rather than fight _nob_'s rather
 fraudulent claims, I submitted to %g3
 judgment and was directed to pay a bribe
 of 300 gold to an assistant named
 _ast_ in ___atown_ to
 forbear actions against the Archaeologists.
