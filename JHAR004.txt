QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  We recently sent a pair of members off to
<ce>  ___rural_ to follow a lead on
<ce>  some excavation they were undertaking in
<ce>  a remote site. According to their report, they
<ce>  were using some sort of magic to detect
<ce>  enchantments or life or some other matter
<ce>  when something dead began moving and
<ce>  uprooting itself. Since then we've been informed
<ce>  that the mummy is not returning to sleep, and
<ce>  the property owners are rather furious.
<ce>  Are you capable of returning the dead to
<ce>  their proper place?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Well, at least you're honest. The last person
<ce>  we sent didn't make it back alive.
<--->
<ce>  We need this resolved, now.
<--->
<ce>  This is a simple matter. Why won't anyone accept it?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Thank you. The %t, for whatever reason, refuses
<ce>  to take responsibility in this matter, so we
<ce>  can only depend on persons such as yourself to
<ce>  do the clean up. We have to give a report to
<ce>  some officials of %crn within =timer_
<ce>  days, and I need you to have fixed the problem and
<ce>  returned by that time. I'll have _reward_ gold pieces
<ce>  here for you when that happens. And do be sure to
<ce>  stop by a temple if the battle turns grievous, would you?
<ce>  Disease can be an awful thing. Best of luck
<ce>  on your way to ___rural_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You were supposed to slay the mummy at
<ce>  ___rural_ and return to ___questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  How was it? I assumed it would be a fairly standard matter,
<ce>  once we got past the "dead rising and ambling about"
<ce>  statement. Yet another success on your guild record.
<ce>  Take the gold and my thanks.
<--->
<ce>  I certainly hope you don't feel we're merely using you for
<ce>  menial tasks. These matters are just as important as
<ce>  historical excavations. We maintain our good name through
<ce>  guild members such as yourself. Here is the gold I promised,
<ce>  which I hope you accept with my thanks.

Message: 1020
<ce>  The mummy has been defeated. You hope there's no
<ce>  actual reason it would come back a second time.

%qdt:
