  Lord Spode has gotten himself into another problem.
Thankfully he does not bear the burden of it himself,
but he needs it resolved nonetheless.
He's getting better with the "cursed" finger.
His most recent wish was that his business exceed
that of his most prominent rival in ____res_.
However, rather than the finger granting him
excess wealth, it decided to ruin his
foe's property, ___res_.
Bandits have taken up residence on it and
demand fees of the people who live there.
Residents across ____res_ have grown suspicious
of this strange turn of events and wonder
whether the rumors of Spode's "enchanted finger"
are true. You'll want to get over there and clean
the property of the criminals, lest someone believe
the rumors enough to try to steal it.
Surely if it has been in poor hands until now,
it would be worse in the possession of a stranger.

<ce> You arrive on the property and see two
<ce> burglars separate themselves from the crowd.
<ce> They signal to each other and move
<ce> to intercept you.

 Lord Bertram Spode has cursed someone else
 with the "good luck" finger I delivered to
 him on behalf of the Archaeologists.
 He demands that I go
 to ___res_ of ____res_ and
 kill some bandits which are now haunting
 his property. I have =timer_ days to do so,
 lest he ruin my reputation.

Message:  1016
<ce>  Lord Spode demanded that you kill the bandits
<ce>  on his rival's property by now.
