<ce>                    We have an assignment we believe you would
<ce>                    succeed with, assuming you aren't as jelly-kneed
<ce>                    as a few of our other members. There's an enchanted
<ce>                    object in ___dungeon_ we believe to
<ce>                    be of Breton origin, at least a few centuries old. We
<ce>                    don't know precisely what it does, which entails a
<ce>                    certain degree of risk. If I offered you _reward_ gold
<ce>                    pieces, would you head down and pick it up for us?

<ce>                    Jelly-kneed as them all, then.
<--->
<ce>                    You will never rise in rank with that attitude.

<ce>                    Really, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Then perhaps it's not a lost cause after all.
<ce>               I look forward to your return. Just, please,
<ce>               be prepared for anything. There is no hurry
<ce>               in this matter, so grab the object only when
<ce>               you feel yourself prepared. I will hope to see
<ce>               it within =traveltime_ days. Take a locator charge.
<ce>               It will no doubt help you this time.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Thank you once more, %pcf. Your service is well received.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I hope you share your adventures with the newer members, %pcf.

 _questgiver_ of the
 Archaeologists has sent me to
 ___dungeon_ to get
 an enchanted _mitem_.
 I should be prepared for anything.
 It must arrive in ___questgiver_
 within =traveltime_ days.

<ce>           You inspect the _mitem_. It has an
<ce>           engraved symbol of a sun. You seem
<ce>           to hear hissing as you hold it, as well as
<ce>           whispering in an unintelligible language.

<ce>           You inspect the _mitem_. It has an
<ce>           engraved symbol of a moon. You seem
<ce>           to hear howling as you hold it, as well as
<ce>           whispering in an unintelligible language.

<ce>           engraved symbol of a sun. You seem
<ce>           to hear raspy breathing as you hold it, as well
<ce>           as whispering in an unintelligible language.

<ce>           You inspect the _mitem_. It has an

<ce>           to hear squeaking as you hold it, as well
<ce>           as whispering in an unintelligible language.

<ce>               What a joy to see you! This little object is quite
<ce>               powerful. I'll mitigate the enchantment for now
<ce>               so you can get some peace and quiet, but I'll merely
<ce>               say this is worth years of studying texts. Just listen
<ce>               to it closely. You'll learn a lot. If we hear of some
<ce>               other similar trinket, I hope you'll be up for the
<ce>               challenge. Have your gold.

<ce>               I also wanted to mention that I have your _reward_
<ce>               gold pieces here, but I received this _altrew_
<ce>               while you were out. It's enchanted, but I don't know
<ce>               what with. Would you prefer it as a reward instead
<ce>               of the gold?
